##Description:

These are Java Script program applications for various tasks. There are three projects at hand here each with various tasks;

##The student grading App:

The JavaScript code defines a function 'calculateGrade' that prompts the user input, and then calculates and displays the corresponding grade. It uses a series of 'if' and 'else if' statements to determine the grade based on the input marks.

##The speedo meter App:

In this JavaScript code, you call the 'calculateDemeritPoints' function with the speed of the cars as an argument to check the demerit points for that speed it will print "OK" if the speed is less than 70, print the number of demerit points if the speed is over 70, and print "License suspended" if the driver gets 12 demerits.
